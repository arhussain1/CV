I am a junior full stack web developer. One who enjoys learning about new software and technology like Computer Aided Design(CAD), Photoshop and Hatch embroidery software to name a few. I am also interested in building and fixing computers (my current project: Macbook air).
 
I began my coding journey by completing beginner courses on Codecademy and doing basic challenges on codewars (8 and 7 Kyu Katas). Since then, I have recently completed an intensive 16 week software developer course at Makers Academy, in which I have worked in teams to create web applications. I am now continuing this journey by beginning new projects in a variety of different tech stacks.

- Designed a new mattress core using CAD (Computer Aided Design) software to finalise measurements for all components
- Communicated with members from our supply chain to create custom polyester structures and to ensure adequate quality
- Communicated with our customers to gain feedback on any improvements. 
- Identified a weakness in our central support section, to fix this I added a tensioned support layer coupled with adhesive for added weight distribution.

- Continuously began being trained in multiple areas, within 6 months I received training in 5 different positions.
- My favourite role involved managing over 25 other associates and ensuring they were supplied with everything they needed to do their jobs, a demanding role requiring me to be organised and efficient to avoid delays
