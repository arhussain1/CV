I am a junior full stack web developer. One who enjoys learning about new software and technology like Computer Aided Design(CAD), Photoshop and Hatch embroidery software to name a few. I am also interested in building and fixing computers (my current project: Macbook air).
 
I began my coding journey by completing beginner courses on Codecademy and doing basic challenges on codewars (8 and 7 Kyu Katas). Since then, I have recently completed an intensive 16 week software developer course at Makers Academy, in which I have worked in teams to create web applications. I am now continuing this journey by beginning new projects in a variety of different tech stacks.
