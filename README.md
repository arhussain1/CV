**Let's Do This** (Jun 2022 to Jan 2023)  
Let’s Do This is your go-to source for finding, reviewing and booking the best endurance sport events across the world. Whether you’re looking for your first 5k or your 10th Ironman, we’re the best place to find your next challenge.

- As a member of the Growth CRM team at Lets do this, I am working on a new email tool to allow clients to send large marketing campaigns.

- I was responsible for developing a dynamic field feature that would allow clients to use unique customer attributes in their emails. After diagramming with a senior developer, I implemented my changes and tested them extensively to ensure they were reliable and efficient. Our users have responded positively to the feature and it has made the email tool more customisable and user-friendly, contributing to the overall success of the email tool.

- Recently I worked on a scheduling feature that would allow clients to book email campaigns in advance. I collaborated with the design team to understand the expectations of scheduling UI. I implemented this feature in React using components and hooks. This alongside various other features helped to secure a large client for the company.

## Skills

### Strong communicator
<p>I enjoy helping and teaching others and over the past few months I had so many opportunities to do this. During my final project, I was tasked with developing the backend using express and node js to store player scores for our game. I would regularly need to teach other members of the team how it worked. I taught them using a calm and slow approach while also asking questions to keep my partners engaged. As a result, I successfully explained to three other team members how the backend works and how they can recreate it themselves.
